## Key Findings

1.  **Positive Correlation between Steps and Calorie Burn:** A clear positive relationship exists between the number of steps taken per day and the calories burned. However, the benefits show diminishing returns after approximately 20,000 steps.
2.  **No Correlation Found with Sleep:** The analysis revealed no significant correlation between daily physical activity (steps or calories) and sleep duration or quality in this dataset.
3.  **Peak Activity Hours:** User activity consistently peaks around midday (12 PM) and in the evening (7 PM).
4.  **Stable "Walk Efficiency":** The number of active calories burned per step remains remarkably consistent throughout the day, suggesting that the time of day does not impact the effectiveness of a walk.

## Key Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I developed three key recommendations to help Bellabeat improve user engagement:

1.  **Targeted Notifications:** Send motivational push notifications to users shortly before peak activity times (e.g., 11:30 AM and 6:30 PM) to encourage movement.
2.  **Gamified Monthly Challenge:** Instead of a simple cumulative goal, implement a consistency-based challenge such as **"Achieve 15,000 steps on 10 different days this month."** This is psychologically more motivating and helps build sustainable habits.
3.  **"Every Step Counts" Marketing:** Launch a marketing campaign emphasizing that walking is equally effective for burning calories at any time of day, empowering users to be active whenever it fits their schedule.
